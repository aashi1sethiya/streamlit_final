## ♻ **Why CO2 Emissions Matter** 
- CO2 emissions matter because they fuel **climate change**, **triggering extreme weather events** and **habitat loss**
- Cutting them down is vital to safeguarding ecosystems and ensuring a **sustainable future**

## 🌏 **Built for Empowering Environmental Consciousness**
- Our Co2 Emissions Calculator is designed to shed light on your **carbon footprint** across three major domains: **Commute**, **Food**, and **Appliances**
- With intuitive interfaces and powerful calculations, we aim to inspire informed decisions and meaningful actions towards a greener future

##  **Data**
- Data has been sourced from:
  1. https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/sustainability-indicators/carbon-footprint-factsheet
  2. Cool the Globe App -https://www.cooltheglobe.org/
- All Co2 emissions were stored for a single unit

## 🏗️ **How It Works**

1. **Select Domain:** Choose a domain – Commute, Food, and Appliances –
2. **Input Activities:** Specify your daily activities within the selected domain
3. **Input Predictive Activities:** Choose activities that you could use instead of your usual activities to reduce Co2 Emissions
4. **Calculate Emissions:** Compute your actual and predicted carbon footprint 
5. **Explore Insights:** Understand visualizations of your actual and predicted Co2 emissions savings


## 🛠️ **How It Is Built**
Is is built with these core frameworks and modules:

- **Streamlit** - To create the web app UI and interactivity
- **SVG files** - To create visualisations that display beautiful graphs 
- **E-Charts** - To create dynamic gauge charts
- **Plotly** - To create interactive financial charts

## 🎯 **Key Features**

- **User-input data** - User's data for multiple daily activities
- **Dynamic charts** - Interactive charts to understand impact of your predicted activities

##  **Future Work**

- **Add more features** - Add Re-cycle tab, display reduced carbon footprint, give user option to calculate yearly carbon footprint
- **Add Dynamic charts** - Add charts that compare the Co2 emission of the user with their average counterpart
